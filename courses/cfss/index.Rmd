## Course Description

This is a for-credit, applied course for social scientists with little-to-no programming experience who wish to harness growing digital and computational resources. The focus of the course is on developing a computational framework which students can implement in their own research. Major emphasis is placed on a pragmatic understanding of programming languages and software libraries. Students will leave the course with basic computational skills in a wide variety of techniques and languages; while students will not become expert programmers, they will gain the knowledge of how to adapt and expand these skills as they are presented with new questions and data.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will:

* Construct and execute basic programs in R and Python using elementary programming techniques (e.g. loops, conditional statements, user-defined functions)
* Apply stylistic principles of coding to generate reusable, interpretable code
* Debug programs for errors
* Identify and use external libraries to expand on base functions
* Generate reproducible research with R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks
* Implement statistical analysis
* Visualize information and data using appropriate graphical techniques
* Import data from files or the internet
* Munge raw data into a tidy format
* Scrape websites to collect data for analysis
* Analyze networks
* Parse and analyze text documents
* Implement machine learning algorithms
* Connect to and obtain data from relational databases through local and API access
* Write programs which utilize parallel processing
* Create interactive web pages using Shiny

(Ri)1,39.9,"(Ri)1 (pronounced rye one) is a Kentucky straight rye whiskey produced by Beam Global Spirits. This rye whiskey is a quite a bit different from the traditional rye in that it is lighter and sweeter but retains that spicy snap.

It does have some great cocktail potential and I can see it being used for its unique profile by bartenders to create some interesting new whiskey cocktails.

This technique is at the heart of The Balvenie DoubleWood. It sees the whisky matured first in American oak barrels, which impart soft sweet vanilla notes, before being transferred to European oak sherry casks, where the second cask aging adds rich spicy flavors, depth and fullness of flavor. An elder sibling to the popular DoubleWood 12 Year Old, this new aged version shares the same DNA and the honeyed, spicy characteristics as the 12 Year Old, but it is distinctly different, with deeper vanilla notes, hints of green apple, creamy toffee and a striking richness and complexity.",Balvenie 17 Yr Doublewood,Whiskey,Spirits,43.0,750.0,40-80

Cherry Flav. Whiskey,12.5,"One of the most popular new sectors of the spirits business is a somewhat unusual one. Building on the popularity of the ubiquitous flavored vodkas, several distillers have started introducing flavored whiskeys. According to the production information, Evan Williams Cherry Reserve combines aged bourbon with ""natural cherry flavor."" The distiller can't legally call this bourbon, so you won't find that word anywhere on the bottle. But that's what it is, albeit with the addition of cherry and some other stuff as well, like caramel coloring. Presumably sugar, too, considering how sweet it is. On the nose, it's all sweet cherries. Very nice if you like cherries -- and I love them. So I enjoyed the aroma very much. The cherries come across strong in the taste as well, along with a little nutty bitterness and a modest alcohol kick. There's a hint of almonds, which made me think of Amaretto. It's nice stuff. Sweet -- you'll notice I keep mentioning that -- but with a pleasing flavor. The cherry is more authentic than you usually find in spirits like this. It thankfully avoids that cough syrup taste that plagues a lot of the competitors. This liqueur is 35% alcohol, making it almost as strong as standard spirits, which are generally 40%. So be careful. Even with the high alcohol content (for a liqueur), it still goes down pretty easily and could sneak up on you.",Evan Williams,Whiskey,Spirits,70.0,750.0,40-80

Galliano L'autentico,19.9,"Galliano, properly known as ""Liquore Galliano L'Autentico"", is a sweet herbal liqueur created in 1896 by Italian distiller and brandy producer Arturo Vaccari of Livorno in Tuscany. Vaccari named the spirit after Giuseppe Galliano, an Italian hero of the First ItaloEthiopian War at the end of the 19th century. Its vivid yellow color, currently derived from Tartrazine (a lemon-yellow azo dye), symbolized the Gold Rushes of the 1890s. Galliano is 60 proof (30% by volume). Among its approximately 30 herbal ingredients are star anise, Mediterranean anise, ginger, and citrus and vanilla. Galliano has a similar appearance to Strega (liqueur), another Italian herbal liqueur. Galliano is sweet and has a complex, vanilla-anise flavor with subtle citrus and woodsy herbal under notes. It is used both as a digestif (meant for drinking after heavy meals), and as an ingredient for cocktails, most notably the Harvey Wallbangers. The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavored liqueurs such as Sambuca, Pernod, Anisette. Galliano is produced by first infusing grain-neutral alcohol with the herbal flavoring agents, distilling the liquid, and then infusing with pressed vanilla. In the final production stage, the vanilla-herb base infusion is blended with distilled water, refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol.",Galliano,Cordials,Spirits,84.6,375.0,80-120

George Bowman,24.9,"During the late 17th century, imported rum became exceedingly popular in Colonial America. Early estimates of rum consumption in those colonies suggested every settler drank an average of three imperial gallons of rum each year. To support this demand, a substantial trade was developed between the Caribbean and the American Colonies. This trade of sugar, slaves, molasses and rum was quite profitable. The Sugar Act in 1764 disrupted this trade and may have helped cause the American Revolution. Nevertheless, the popularity of rum continued. This Dark Imported Rum commemorates George Bowman and other early American Colonists. Tasting Notes: This special pot-still rum has been distilled, aged and blended much like it was centuries ago. Imported from a small rum maker down south amidst the palm trees and sugar cane, this rum spent years aging in the Caribbean heat to garner its dark color and full flavor. This dark colonial era rum is hand bottled in Fredericksburg, Virginia, but the taste will remind you of warm Caribbean beaches. The subtle aroma of coconut and vanilla are followed by the rich flavors of molasses, honey and brown sugar.

Hatfield & Mccoy Moonshine,27.8,"Handed down for generations, the recipe used to make Hatfield & McCoy Moonshine is as authentic and original as the mountains and streams that bear the family names.

With one taste, the “old timers” will tell you Hatfield & McCoy Moonshine is second to none.

As any discriminating drinker can see, they share DNA - in their smoky nose, unmistakable spice and slight tones of dried fruit. But the similarities end there. With this blend, the exclusive taste trumps all. It's no wonder whisky critics and aficionados have snatched up the limited number of bottles produced, making it even more elusive and mysterious.

Even with the maturation being carried out in 1st fill bourbons, quarter casks and sherry butts, the intense bonfire ash smell of the earthy peat cannot be masked BODY: Powerful yet with a creamy consistency PALATE: With no water, a large initial burst of peat belies the slight lack on the nose but is gentled on the tongue by the creamier flavours of vanilla and fruit with just a suggestion of sherry sweetness. With a trace of water the peat reek is gentled, allowing the more complex flavours of citrus fruits and spices to come through.

The term “sour mash” is frequently misunderstood.

This results in a slightly sweeter and heavier bodied whiskey; it is not at all sour as the term suggests.

Reyka Vodka,26.9,"The Look: A clear, squat bottle festooned with stylized steam (Reyka is the Icelandic word for geothermal steam). The vodka itself was clear and completely sediment free - as much as we wanted to see chunks of lava rock in there. The Nose: Not a huge nose on this guy. Smelled like booze - not much more to it than that, really, but we caught a hint of something sweet there too. The Taste: The biggest flavors here were lemons and pepper, but they didn't get in the way of a nice straightforward vodka flavor with a smooth finish. The lingering taste was the spice of pepper, and we could see Reyka making a kickass Bloody Mary. We guess filtering vodka through lava rocks works - it's a good, solid neutral spirit with some nice character we don't often taste in more conventional distillation methods. The Verdict: We're fans of Reyka's attitude, and we're fans of the vodka too. Definitely worth picking up for a night of mixing up vodka cocktails or even sipping on the rocks, but we'll have to reserve judgment on whether it actually tastes like Iceland until we actually make the trip over there.

Sammy's Beach Bar Rum,25.3,"It starts with the cane. Sammy's Beach Bar Rum is made from the finest sugar cane grown in the best cane growing region in the world - Hawaii. Pure first-growth and first-press sugar cane from Hawaii produces the most flavorful juice possible. We could have been like all the others, following the standard one year maturation period of cane used in other premium rums. But to make the finest premium rum possible, the cane in Sammy's Beach Bar Rum matures for a full two years before it can meet our standards. This gives the sugar from the cane its intense character and wonderful aroma. After carefully selecting only the best crops, the canes are harvested and then gently pressed near our distillery. This pressing extracts the first-press sugar cane juice. The cane juice is fermented for 5 days in custom made vats to create ""mash"" with an incredible bouquet. Our master distiller oversees the full production process, hand-distilling the mash in small batches using unique handmade pot stills to purify the finished product while leaving the cane's distinct character. The result is a pure premium rum with a delicately delicious flavor and a hint of tropical Hawaii.

Schladerer Williams Birne,59.9,"Schladerer has its origin in the little town of Staufen in Germany’s historic Black Forest. Over 160 years ago, Sixtus Schladerer began making fruit brandies for guests at his restaurant. The product was something intimate, to be handcrafted and served to close friends. It is with this belief in mind that Schladerer is still family-owned and adheres to traditional values of responsibility and commitment to quality above all else. They have the vision and experience to bring the culture and incomparable delight of fruit brandy to all people with a passion for high class spirits. Besides this objective to produce a premium product, Schladerer continues to honor the family tradition of supporting cultural and social welfare projects in the region. Schladerer fruit brandies are best served slightly chilled and neat in an Armagnac glass or Champagne flute. They make an excellent digestif after a meal. Although the delicate nature of Schladerer brandies make them ideal on their own, they can be mixed with Champagne or sparkling wine, then garnished with the corresponding fruit makes a delightful cocktail. Or add 1 oz. of brandy to coffee for an after-dinner drink. In addition to being an after dinner drink, soaking fruit in Schladerer infuses it with flavor, or they can be poured over ice cream.",Schladerer Williams,Brandy,Spirits,80.0,750.0,40-80

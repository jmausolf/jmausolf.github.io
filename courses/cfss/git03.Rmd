*You only have to do this once per machine.*

In order to track changes and attribute them to the correct user, we need to tell Git your name and email address. Open the [shell](shell.html) on your computer. From there, type the following commands (replace the relevant parts with your own information):

* `git config --global user.name 'Benjamin Soltoff'`
    * This can be your full name, your username on GitHub, whatever you want. Each of your commits will be logged with this name, so make sure it is informative *for others*.
* `git config --global user.email 'ben@bensoltoff.com'`
    * This must be the email address you used to register on GitHub.

You will not see any output from these commands. To ensure the changes were made, run `git config --global --list`.

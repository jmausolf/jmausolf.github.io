* Demonstrate how to use `sparklyr` for machine learning using the Titanic data set

## Slides and links

* [Notes from class](distrib-comp_01.html)

* [The split-apply-combine strategy for data analysis](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper) - paper by Hadley Wickham establishing a general overview of split-apply-combine problems. Note that the `plyr` package is now deprecated in favor of `dplyr` and the other `tidyverse` packages
